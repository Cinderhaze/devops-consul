devopsstc consul talk
----------------------

Started by getting Consul runnin in a few hand-created vagrant instances, bootstrapped using puppet.

I tried to look for a more lightweight way of doing it... docker?

Right now I'm working though
http://jlordiales.me/2015/02/03/registrator/

I'm trying to run docker from inside the VM, and I don't have a route to any registry..

core@host-2 ~ $ docker run --rm progrium/consul cmd:run 172.28.128.3 -d -v /mnt:/data
Unable to find image 'progrium/consul' locally

Sam looked at it, and was seeing the same issue, it may be a problem with the coreos base image.  I'm going to try replacing the image with the base image used by boot2docker and see if it fixes it.
